Heroku Configuration
Simply just leave the Config as it is.


Local Configuration
Fortunately there are no Mandatory vars for the UniBorg Support Config.

# Mandatory Vars
```
[+] Only two of the environment variables are mandatory.

[+] This is because of telethon.errors.rpc_error_list.ApiIdPublishedFloodError

    [-] APP_ID:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
    [-] API_HASH :   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
    
[+] The b lac will not work without setting the mandatory vars.
```
